           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>STEMA is a social platform that facilitates girls, educators, and parents to form the STEM community to encourage them to stay in the STEM field. With wearable devices, girls can learn how to code and connect to the STEMA website to share their progress and teach each other. I took a role in extensive user research, information architecture, visual design, Industrial design, and prototyping/Testing. For this project, I used AdobeXD, Figma, Adobe suite, Balsamiq, Invision, Maze, Solidworks, and 3D printer.</p>

            <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>Elementary school girls age between 9 to 13 tend to lose interest in STEM education. While the scores of standardized achievement tests on science and math between boys and girls in fourth grade have merely no difference, girls continue to lose their interest in STEM-related subjects and activities.</p>

            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p class="last">The solution is to design a platform and wearable device to facilitate girls, educators, and caregivers to form a STEM community where they can access resources and motivate each other to stay in the STEM field.</p>

         <article class="intro">
           <h3>User Research</h3>
           <p>I started this project with affinity diagram, ethnographic research, observational study, user survey, competitive analysis, and user persona to understand the target users in-depth and analyze the existing market so that I could offer the most suitable solution to their problems. </p>
           <!--<p class = "note">* The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with a different background.</p>-->

           <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
           <p>I started the project by brainstorming my awareness of STEM including existent STEM products, programs, media outlet, advertisement of STEM, STEM education, and cost of STEM activities and programs. Then I created an affinity diagram by organizing my attributes. This process helped me to start thinking more deeply about the subject.</p>


           <h3>Ethonographic Research</h3>
           <p>The purpose of the ethnographic research was to analyze how girls aged between 9 to 13 years old interact with STEM subjects. I felt that it was essential for me to observe the relationships with each other while learning, the existing STEM programs, the environment, and the interaction with activities and products in order for me to design a product that could help girls interested in STEM subjects.</p>

           <h3>Observational Study</h3>
           <p>I started the research by visiting a workshop that was hosted by Apple in Palo Alto to introduce young generations to the technology. I conducted an observational study at the Ardenwood School in Fremont, CA while “Girls Who Code” meeting was taking place. Additionally, I have visited several science museums such as the Lawrence Hall of Science and Chabot Space & Science Center to observe existent STEM activities, programs, and products and how girls interacted with them.</p>

           <h3>User Survey</h3>
           <p>I took a survey for 30+ girls aged between 9 to 13 years old who were the members of “Girls Who Code” program in Ardenwood school in Fremont, CA. My aim for this survey was to find out the usage of the smart devices, girls attitude level in STEM, and their preferable STEM products so that I can design a product that suits their needs and interests while understanding my target users.</p>

               <p>• <strong> Disorganized user flow & site organization:</strong> It is hard to understand where the content is located making it confusing for users to find the information they are looking for. </p>
               <p>• <strong>Simple & clear navigation:</strong> mn-stem.com provides a simple and straight-forward platform that is easy to navigate. </p>

             <h3>User Persona</h3>
             <p>After the several user research, I interviewed and created 2 personas who represent our target users.  They are looking for a solution to keep staying in the STEM field while creating the STEM community they can turn to when they need support.</p>

           <h4>Challenges I encountered</h4>
           <p><strong>What worked the best </strong> for me was to understand the users by talking to experts in the filed and observe STEM classroom where girls interact with. Because of the extensive research, I was able to identify the problem and offer the best solution for target users. </p>
           <p><strong>What did not work</strong> for me  was creating a vague wireframe. I should have spent more time putting details in wireframe so that it requires less revisions on high fidelity mockup. For next project, I am going to spend more time focused on adding details.</p>
           <p class="last"><strong>What I have learned</strong> in this project was the importance of the iterative design process. For instance, the initial homepage was overwhelming and did not provide clear navigation. After the series of usability testing, I redesigned it with a clear visual hierarchy with plenty of white space to navigate the page without overwhelming the users. </p>
