           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>Tone is a product that captures the tone of voice using machine learning algorithms and alerts users when it rises above average to prevent them from negative consequences caused by outbursts. I took a role in user research, information architecture, visual design, and prototyping/Testing. For this innovative project, I used Figma, adobe suite, Invision, Maze, and Google Forms.</p>

           <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
           <p>The problem is that when people are under stress, they tend to lose their temper more easily. That could lead to a negative impact on their life. While some people try to manage their stress and anger by being proactive and practicing mindful activities, it is a long-term solution and it does not necessarily prevent them from raising their voice at someone they care.</p>

           <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
           <p class="last">The solution is to design an app that captures the tone of the user’s voice and provide them with a direct solution to mitigate the outburst caused by stress and negative experiences in daily life.</P>
          <!-- <p>Features include</p>
           <P>• Tone Analysis and Self-Evaluation</p>
           <p>• Customized sound & color </p>
           <p>• Immediate Stress Releif Activities</p>-->

           <h3>User Survey</h3>
           <p>I started the user research by user survey to find out which methods people use to cope with immediate stress, which particular apps/products they use for stress relief, how effective they are working, the main cause of stress and if they would like to use an app that resolves immediate stress to avoid hurting relationships or negative consequences. </p>
           <p class = "note">* The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with a different background.</p>

           <p>These data revealed to me that there is a demand for an app/product that copes with people’s immediate stress by providing tangible results. Therefore, I believe an app to help users to manage their outburst/stress by providing them with a direct solution could significantly improve their stress level. </p>

           <p>First, I conducted branding research, brainstorming, and mind mapping. Then I created a mood board to establish the feel and direction for this project. Since it is a product that helps users manage their outbursts, the focus of the branding is calmness and simplicity. With the branding concept, I sketched various logo and created the final logo as well as branding and design style guide. </p>

           <p><strong>What worked the best </strong> for me was to be able to connect with the target users by interviewing and understanding their frustrations. By conducting through user research and having understood what they were going through, I felt more compelled to design a solution that could help them to manage their immediate stress/anger. </p>
           <p><strong>What did not work</strong> for me in this project was to find enough target users to test the product and get feedback as much as I wished for because of the time constraints. If I had more time, I would have conducted more usability tests to see how I could improve the product further. </p>
           <p class="last"><strong>What I have learned</strong> in this project was the importance of sketching and putting my ideas, designs, words, and concepts down. It helped me to organize my ideas and develop them more in-depth because I was able to go back and build better designs for logo, wireframe, or branding. I will keep continuing to sketch and ideate to create better solutions in the future.</p>
