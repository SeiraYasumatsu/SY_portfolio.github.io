        <h1> Growing up in Japan</h1>
        <p>I was fascinated with beautiful papers and packagings. Something about the texture of the material, color,  typography, and illustration sparked my interest. There was a blue washi paper packaging for the letter set I received from my grandmother and a tiny acrylic yellow packaging for a hard round candy “Kon-pei-to”. I was mesmerized by its design and the craftsmanship. </p>
        <p>While my interest in art and design never ceased, my passion for children drove me to be an early childhood educator. I started to notice toys, pieces of furniture, or systems which were not working well with children or teachers. So slowly I began to address each problem by observing children and the environment, identifying the exact problem, and implementing the solution by designing a tool or better activity for them. </p>
        <p>Along with various design projects, I rediscovered my deep passion for design with the same butterfly I had when I collected the beautiful things as a child. But this time I was not mesmerized by the attractive object. <mark>I was intrigued by the process of design and what design can achieve.</mark> Afterward, I could not resist but to pursue a degree in industrial design to learn further about design. </p>

        <h1>User-centered Design</h1>
        <p>While I loved working with different materials and building 3D objects as an industrial designer, <mark>what I enjoyed the most for me was the process of finding the right problem to solve, getting feedback, and offering the creative solution to the problem.</mark> When I was working on <ins><strong><a href="http://longevity.stanford.edu/stanford-center-longevity-design-challenge-winners-announced/">the Stanford design challenge </a></strong></ins>to promote a healthy habit for longevity, I was fortunate to be able to work with so many elderlies who love gardening. With their insights and feedbacks, I designed and built a versatile and mobile gardening station. </p>
        <p>While I was presenting it at the Felton Institute in San Francisco, the elders who have a different background and level of English proficiency were able to connect with the device and it excited them with the possibility to be able to garden even when their knee was injured. </p>
        <p>From this challenge and so many other design projects I tackled, the result of the effective design has a positive impact on real users. So, I am a real practitioner of a user-centered design that facilitates user’s needs by building a deep empathy, sharing the product with users as often as I can, and putting my solution out to more users in the world.</p>

       <h1>Experiences I bring</h1>
       <p>After I graduated with an Industrial design degree, I enrolled in Bloc’s UX Design Apprenticeship program where <mark>I learned to push myself as a designer and a front-end developer to offer the best solution for the real users.</mark> </p>
       <p>From years of working with children, I am a great <strong>listener</strong>, <strong>observer</strong>, and <strong>team player with patience</strong>.</p>
       <p> As an industrial designer, I bring my knowledge of 3D modeling, materials, and <strong>my curiosity for how things are made and operate</strong>. </p>
       <p>Of course, born and raised in Japan, I also bring my love for food and respect for things and people around me.</p>
