           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>Behub is a family-friendly app that helps to manage and organize a family’s schedule and content by collaborating among family members. I took a role in user research, informational architecture, visual design, and prototyping/Testing. For this project, I used Figma, adobe suite, Invision, Maze, and Google Forms.</p>

          <article class="problem">
            <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>The busy parents with kids have an exhausting time managing a family’s schedule and support each other in the most efficient way. While they communicate via email, text, or phone call, the changes they discussed are often forgotten among other things. </p>
          </article>
          <article class="solution">
            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p>This collaboration platform provides clean and easy to browse calendar, folders to collect and save interesting contents, message feature to communicate and collaborate instantly, and a gentle reminder to update the schedule at the preferred time: one app to bring families and friends closer.

         <article class="user-survey">
           <h3>User Survey</h3>
           <p>The client was interested in going in the cloud storage and organization market. They had some features in mind including saving content users find on the web, organizing that content, and uploading files. The important aspect of this product was collaboration. They believed that collaboration and social sharing features were what users would like to have. Since my client did not have a clear vision for the project nor the target market, I began by user survey to test their assumptions about the user’s wants and needs.</p>
           <p>*The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with a different background.</p>
         </article>

         <article class="surveyQuestions">
           <h4>Survey Questions include<h4>
           <p>•  Why did you start using the particular cloud storage or organizational app?</p>

           <p>•  When you use collaboration features, who do you often collaborate with?  </p>
           <p>•  What kind of contents do you share and work collaboratively? </p>
           <p>•  What kind of contents do you think you want to share and work collaboratively if you do use collaborative features? (for those who are not current users of collaboration features)</p>

         <article class="Key Findings">
           <h4>Key Findings</h4>
           <p>1.  People who currently do not use cloud storage/organizational app  would like to share pictures and contents they find on the website.</p>
           <p>2.  <strong>90% </strong> of people use collaboration features for work.</p>
           <p>3.  <strong>40% </strong> of people use collaboration features with partner or friends.</p>
           <p>4.  <strong>60% </strong> of parents are not satisfied with the current method of managing their family’s schedule. </p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>I conducted a SWOT analysis and heuristic evaluation while studying the user-flow for three competitive companies including Evernote, Pinterest, Trello. </p>

            <p>D. Recognition rather than recall</p>

          <article class="keypoints">
            <p>•    Instructions for use of the system for Evernote is lacking and it is difficult to remember how it works especially on the mobile app.</p>
            <p>•    Trello does not support undo and redo. It leaves users with confusion and frustration. </p>
            <p>•    The system for Pinterest caters to a wide range of users, but it lacks flexibility for experienced users. </p>

            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>After the user survey and the competitive analysis, I found out that people use collaboration features for their work and there is a niche market for parents/family who can benefit from collaboration features for better communication and schedule and content management. </p>

             <p>The main reason why parents were not satisfied with the current method of managing their family schedule was because they tend to forget to update the calendar when changes occur.

Features include the gentle reminder, the update reminder, automatic update reminder after messaging, and reminder stickers to allow users to fit their needs. </p>

           <h3>Branding</h3>
           <p>First, I conducted branding research, brainstorming, and mind mapping. Then I created a mood board to establish the feel and direction for this project. Since I wanted this product to be <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>calm</strong>, <strong>soothing</strong>, <strong>positive</strong>, and <strong>cheerful</strong>, I collected images, words, textures that echo those values. With the branding concept, I sketched various logo and created the final logo as well as branding and design style guide. </p>

           <h5>Logo iterations</h5>
           <p>I sketched many variations of the logo using a bee, but they did not really click with the branding concept and vision I had for the product. After further explorations, I came up with the final logo using 3 hexagons with geometric typeface logo. </p>

           <h5>Why behub?</h5>
           <p>I chose to utilize the symbol of bee which reflects the <strong>community</strong>, <strong>brightness</strong>, and <strong>personal power</strong> and each hexagon represent each element=collaborator coming together to collaborate. The name originates from the bee, but also “being” yourself + the community, place where a user can come and collaborate together. </p>
