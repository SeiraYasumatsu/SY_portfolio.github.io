           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>Behub is a family-friendly app that helps to manage and organize a family’s schedule and content by collaborating among family members. I took a role in user research, informational architecture, visual design, and prototyping/Testing. For this project, I used Figma, adobe suite, Invision, Maze, and Google Forms.</p>

            <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>The busy parents with kids have an exhausting time managing a family’s schedule and support each other in the most efficient way. While they communicate via email, text, or phone call, the changes they discussed are often forgotten among other things. </p>


            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p class="last">This collaboration platform provides clean and easy to browse calendar, folders to collect and save interesting contents, message feature to communicate and collaborate instantly, and a gentle reminder to update the schedule at the preferred time: one app to bring families and friends closer.

           <h3>User Survey</h3>
           <p>The client was interested in going in the cloud storage and organization market. They had some features in mind including saving content users find on the web, organizing that content, and uploading files. The important aspect of this product was collaboration. They believed that collaboration and social sharing features were what users would like to have. Since my client did not have a clear vision for the project nor the target market, I began by user survey to test their assumptions about the user’s wants and needs.</p>
           <p class = "note">* The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with a different background.</p>

           <p>•  When you use collaboration features, who do you often collaborate with?  </p>
           <p>•  What kind of contents do you share and work collaboratively? </p>
           <p>•  What kind of contents do you think you want to share and work collaboratively if you do use collaborative features? (for those who are not current users of collaboration features)</p>

           <h3>Branding</h3>
           <p>First, I conducted branding research, brainstorming, and mind mapping. Then I created a mood board to establish the feel and direction for this project. Since I wanted this product to be <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>calm</strong>, <strong>soothing</strong>, <strong>positive</strong>, and <strong>cheerful</strong>, I collected images, words, textures that echo those values. With the branding concept, I sketched various logo and created the final logo as well as branding and design style guide. </p>

           <p class="last"><strong> The challenge I ran into </strong> while working on this project was the user flow of the message feature. Initially, the message feature was placed in the calendar feature. I believed that users would like to contact the collaborators when they would like to update the schedule to arrange their schedules. However, the usability testing proved that users had a difficult time finding the message feature, therefore I decided to move it to the collaborator’s page where many users were intuitively going to find it. I learned that it was crucial to get feedback from users as often as possible. It is so easy to miss something obvious when I am working on the same project for a long period of time.</p>
