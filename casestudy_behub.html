           <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
           <p>Behub is a family-friendly app that helps to manage and organize a family’s schedule and content by collaborating among family members. I took a role in user research, informational architecture, visual design, and prototyping/Testing. For this project, I used Figma, adobe suite, Invision, Maze, and Google Forms.</p>

            <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>The busy parents with kids have an exhausting time managing a family’s schedule and support each other in the most efficient way. While they communicate via email, text, or phone call, the changes they discussed are often forgotten among other things. </p>

          <article class="project">
            <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
            <p class="last">This collaboration platform provides clean and easy to browse calendar, folders to collect and save interesting contents, message feature to communicate and collaborate instantly, and a gentle reminder to update the schedule at the preferred time: one app to bring families and friends closer.

           <h3>User Survey</h3>
           <p>The client was interested in going in the cloud storage and organization market. They had some features in mind including saving content users find on the web, organizing that content, and uploading files. The important aspect of this product was collaboration. They believed that collaboration and social sharing features were what users would like to have. Since my client did not have a clear vision for the project nor the target market, I began by user survey to test their assumptions about the user’s wants and needs.</p>
           <p class = "note">* The survey questions were completed by over 30 people. Demographics of the responders included parents who have children, young professionals between 18-34, students, and full-time employees with a different background.</p>

           <h3>Branding</h3>
           <p>First, I conducted branding research, brainstorming, and mind mapping. Then I created a mood board to establish the feel and direction for this project. Since I wanted this product to be <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>calm</strong>, <strong>soothing</strong>, <strong>positive</strong>, and <strong>cheerful</strong>, I collected images, words, textures that echo those values. With the branding concept, I sketched various logo and created the final logo as well as branding and design style guide. </p>

              <p>Based on the user feedback, I iterated a few more wireframe designs and here are 3 main improvements I made. </p>

              <img src="images/Impro1_wireframe.png" alt="welcome page">
              <h5>1. Welcome Page</h5>
              <p><strong>Eliminated unnecessary step </strong>for users to take by creating one welcome page where users can sign up, log in, or take a tour of the main features </p>
           </section>

          <section class="container testing">
              <img src="images/Impro2_wireframe.png" alt="Bottom navigation">
              <h5>2. Bottom Navigation</h5>
              <p>Kept the same main bottom navigation for all the pages for consistency and smooth transition between different page</p>
          </section>

          <section class="container testing">
              <img src="images/Impro3_wireframe.png" alt="no Dead-ends">
              <h5>3. Remove the Dead-ends</h5>
              <p>Few screens needed to have a more obvious way for users to move on to the next screen, so I added the exit icon on the top right</p>

           <h3>A/B Testing</h3>
           <p>After I designed the high fidelity mockups, I performed A/B test for 2 particular designs which included a welcome screen for the app and welcome page instructions with illustrations or photos.</p>

            <h5>1. Welcome Page</h5>
            <p>75% of users preferred the right design.The image and the feel resonated with testers more for the family-themed app.</p>

        <section class="container testing">
            <img src="images/preTest2.png" alt="Main Feature Visual Design">
            <h5>2. Main Feature Visual Design</h5>
            <p><strong>65% </strong> of users preferred the design with the photo image instead of the illustration. They liked the clean and modern look and feel of the design. </p>

           <img src="images/U1.png" alt="Add Icon">
           <h5>1. Bolder Add Icon on the calendar main page</h5>
           <p> The add icon on the calendar main page was not standing out for some users, so I decided to change it to a bolder add icon.</p>

         <section class ="container testing">
           <img src="images/U2.png" alt="Message Feature">
           <h5>2. Message Feature</h5>
           <p>During the test, 70% of users had gone to the collaborator's page to find the message feature. Therefore, I decided to move it to the collaborator page where they intuitively sought it out.</p>

         <section class ="container testing">
           <img src="images/U3.png" alt="Logo placement">
           <h5>3. Logo Placement</h5>
           <p>I adjusted the background image and the logo placement to create a better visual hierarchy without interfering with each other. </p>

         <h4>Challenges I encountered</h4>
         <p><strong>What worked the best </strong>for me for this project was to find the right target market by conducting user research, competitive analysis, and user persona.</p>
         <p><strong> The challenge I ran into </strong> while working on this project was the user flow of the message feature. Initially, the message feature was placed in the calendar feature. I believed that users would like to contact the collaborators when they would like to update the schedule to arrange their schedules. However, the usability testing proved that users had a difficult time finding the message feature, therefore I decided to move it to the collaborator’s page where many users were intuitively going to find it. I learned that it was crucial to get feedback from users as often as possible. It is so easy to miss something obvious when I am working on the same project for a long period of time.</p>
         <!--<p>Future note to myself: <span class="bold">Get the user feedback as often as possible to check the work frequently so I can offer a better solution to the real user’s problems.</span> </p>-->
